### ‚úÖ What is Flutter and what is the concept?
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit by Google to build **natively compiled apps** from a single codebase for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded. It uses **widgets** as the building blocks of UI and supports **reactive, declarative programming**.

---

### ‚úÖ What are the advantages of Flutter?
- Single codebase for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
- Fast development with **hot reload** and **hot restart**
- Rich set of pre-designed widgets (Material & Cupertino)
- High performance with **Dart** and **Skia** rendering engine
- Open-source and large community support
- Beautiful UIs with customizable widgets

---

### ‚úÖ Explain the widget tree in Flutter
In Flutter, everything is a widget. The **widget tree** is a hierarchical structure of widgets that defines the UI. Each widget is responsible for a part of the UI and can contain other widgets. The tree starts from the root widget (usually `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`) and branches out to child widgets.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between Stateful and Stateless widgets?
In Flutter, A **Stateless widget** is immutable, has no state, used to build static UI elements with content that never changes over time.  **Stateful widget** on the other hand, is used when the UI needs to change based on user interaction or data. It has a State object, and when that state updates, the widget rebuilds to reflect the new changes.

---

### ‚úÖ Stateful widget lifecycle
Within the lifecycle of a Stateful widget, the following methods are called in order:
- **createState()**: Called when the widget is created, returns an instance of the State class.
- **initState()**: Called immediately after the widget is created, used to initialize variables or perform initial tasks.
- **didChangeDependencies()**: Called when the widget depends on another widget that changes, used to update the state based on these changes.
- **build()**: Called to build the widget's UI, and is recalled whenever the widget needs to be rebuilt.
- **didUpdateWidget()**: Called when the parent widget changes, used to update the state of the child widget.
- **setState()**: Called to update the widget's state, refreshes the interface.
- **deactivate()**: Called when the widget is removed from the widget tree, used to clean up resources.
- **dispose()**: Called when the widget is no longer used, used to free up resources like listeners, controllers, streams, etc.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between hot reload and hot restart?
- **Hot reload**: Refreshes the UI without losing the current state of the application. Used to quickly see changes in the source code.
- **Hot restart**: Rebuilds the app from the main() method and resets the app state, but does not recompile the native code or relaunch the emulator.
- **Full restart**: Completely recompiles the app from scratch, terminates the Dart VM, and launches a brand new instance.

---

### ‚úÖ What tech is Flutter built with?
Flutter is built with:
- **Dart** (main language)
- **C++** (engine/core rendering)
- **Skia** (graphics engine)
- **Platform channels** for native iOS (Objective-C/Swift) and Android (Java/Kotlin) communication.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the concept of classes in Flutter?
Like in Dart, classes in Flutter define **blueprints for objects**, used to create widgets, manage state, or define models. Flutter heavily uses **OOP concepts** like inheritance, composition, and abstraction.

---

### ‚úÖ Error handler in Flutter?
Use:
- `try-catch` for sync/async errors
- `FlutterError.onError` for framework errors
- `runZonedGuarded()` for uncaught async errors
- `ErrorWidget.builder` to customize red screen errors in UI

---

### ‚úÖ Difference: mixin, extension, sealed, etc.

| Concept     | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Mixin**   | Reuse code across multiple classes (`with`) without inheritance. |
| **Extension** | Add functionality to existing types without changing their source. |
| **Sealed class** | A class restricted to a limited set of subclasses (Dart 3+). |
| **Abstract** | Cannot be instantiated; used for defining interfaces/contracts. |
| **Interface** | Dart doesn't have a keyword ‚Äî any class can act as an interface. |

---

### ‚úÖ MaterialApp vs CupertinoApp
- `MaterialApp`: Follows **Material Design** (Android-style)
- `CupertinoApp`: Follows **iOS-style** (Cupertino design)
Use them to match the native platform look and feel.

---

### ‚úÖ What do you need to do before production?
- Enable **code obfuscation** for security
- Run `flutter build --release`
- Remove unused dependencies
- Check for **performance, memory leaks**
- Handle **permissions**, background modes
- Configure **app icons, splash screen, versioning**
- Sign the app (keystore or iOS certificates)

---

### ‚úÖ What do you understand about Stream and its types?

**Stream**: A sequence of asynchronous events or data. It allows you to listen to data over time, like a radio station.
- **Single subscription stream**: Can be listened to only once. After the first listener, it can't be reused.
- **Broadcast stream**: Can have multiple listeners. Each listener gets its own copy of the data.

Usage:
- **Single subscription**: Only one listener can listen at a time. (Used for one-time async events like file reading or API response).
- **Broadcast**: Multiple listeners can subscribe. (Used for real-time updates like user input, Websockets, or BLoC streams. ).

>Example Code: Counter & Time Ticker

```java
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: StreamExample(),
    );
  }
}

class StreamExample extends StatefulWidget {
  const StreamExample({super.key});

  @override
  State<StreamExample> createState() => _StreamExampleState();
}

class _StreamExampleState extends State<StreamExample> {
  // ‚úÖ Single-subscription Stream: Emits a number once after delay
  Stream<int> singleValueStream = Future.delayed(
    const Duration(seconds: 2),
    () => 42,
  ).asStream();

  // ‚úÖ Broadcast Stream: Emits current time every second to multiple listeners
  late Stream<String> timeBroadcastStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    // Creating a broadcast stream using Stream.periodic
    timeBroadcastStream = Stream.periodic(
      const Duration(seconds: 1),
      (_) => DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    ).asBroadcastStream();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Stream Types Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // üéØ Single-subscription stream
            const Text('Single-subscription stream:'),
            StreamBuilder<int>(
              stream: singleValueStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) {
                if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                  return const CircularProgressIndicator();
                }
                return Text('Value: ${snapshot.data}');
              },
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 30),

            // üéØ Broadcast stream - 1st listener
            const Text('Broadcast stream (Time) - Listener 1:'),
            StreamBuilder<String>(
              stream: timeBroadcastStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) =>
                  Text(snapshot.data ?? 'Waiting...'),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 20),

            // üéØ Broadcast stream - 2nd listener
            const Text('Broadcast stream (Time) - Listener 2:'),
            StreamBuilder<String>(
              stream: timeBroadcastStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) =>
                  Text(snapshot.data ?? 'Waiting...'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


#### üîç What's happening here?

- `singleValueStream`: Created from a `Future`, it emits **one value after 2 seconds** ‚Üí a **single-subscription stream**.
- `timeBroadcastStream`: Emits the **current time every second**, and **both StreamBuilders** can listen ‚Üí a **broadcast stream**.

### ‚úÖ Null-aware operators

**Null-aware operators in Dart** help you write safer and more concise code when dealing with nullable variables. These operators are especially useful in avoiding `null`-related errors. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

1. **`??` (Null-coalescing operator)**  
   This returns the value on its left if it‚Äôs not `null`; otherwise, it returns the value on its right.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   String name = inputName ?? 'Guest';
   ```
   If `inputName` is null, `name` will be `'Guest'`.

2. **`??=` (Null-coalescing assignment operator)**  
   Assigns a value to a variable **only if it is currently null**.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   username ??= 'anonymous';
   ```
   This means "assign `'anonymous'` to `username` if `username` is null."

3. **`?.` (Null-aware access operator)**  
   Calls a method or accesses a property only if the object is not null, preventing a potential null error.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   user?.login();
   ```
   This only calls `login()` if `user` is not null.

4. **`!` (Null assertion operator)**  
   Forcefully tells the compiler that a value is **not null**, even if it's marked as nullable.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   String name = nullableName!;
   ```
   This should be used with caution. If `nullableName` is actually null, it will throw a runtime error.

---

### ‚úÖ Why do we pass a function to a widget?
To allow **child widgets to call back** and notify the parent ‚Äî enabling interaction and state changes (e.g., button press, form submit).

---

### ‚úÖ What is Future in Flutter?

In Flutter, a `Future` represents a value that will be available **sometime in the future**, typically after an **asynchronous operation**.  
- It can either **complete with a value** or **throw an error**.  
- We can use `await` to pause execution until the future completes, or use `.then()` to handle the result when it‚Äôs ready.

---

### ‚úÖ Build types in Flutter
- **Debug**: Fast build, includes debug tools & assertions
- **Profile**: Performance testing, no debugger
- **Release**: Optimized, stripped of debug info, ready for production

---

### ‚úÖ How to ship app to Google Play / App Store?

**For Android:**
- Update version in `pubspec.yaml` and `build.gradle`
- Sign with release key
- `flutter build apk` or `aab`
- Upload to Google Play Console

**For iOS:**
- Set version/build in Xcode
- Use provisioning profiles and certificates
- `flutter build ios`
- Upload via Xcode or Transporter to App Store Connect

---

### ‚úÖ Explain `main()` and `runApp()`

- `main()` is the app's entry point.
- `runApp()` takes a widget (usually `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`) and attaches it to the screen ‚Äî it's how Flutter builds the widget tree.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the BuildContext?
BuildContext is an object that represents the location of a widget in the widget tree. It is required for many operations, such as navigating between screens or showing dialogs.

---

### ‚úÖ What is App State?
App state refers to the data and information that define the current condition of the app. It can include user preferences, authentication status, UI state, and any other data that affects how the app behaves or appears.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the pubspec.yaml file used for?
The `pubspec.yaml` is a congiguration file where to define the dependencies, assets, fonts, and other settings for a Flutter project. It is used by the Dart package manager (`pub`) to manage packages and dependencies.

---

### ‚úÖ Explain the concept of Widget binding
`WidgetBinding` connects Flutter‚Äôs UI system to the platform.
It helps manage things like frame rendering, platform messages, and app lifecycle ‚Äî basically, it keeps your app and the OS in sync.

---

### ‚úÖ Difference between dependency and dev_dependency
- `dependencies`: Required for the app to run in production (e.g., `http`, `provider`).
- `dev_dependencies`: Required only during development (e.g., `flutter_test`, `build_runner`). They are not included in the production build.

---

### ‚úÖ What are types of tests in Flutter?
There are three main types of tests in Flutter:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions or classes (e.g., logic, models).
- **Widget tests**: Test a single widget's UI and behavior (e.g., button press, layout).
- **Integration tests**: Test the entire app or a large part of it (e.g., navigation, API calls). They run on a real device or emulator.

---

### ‚úÖ Navigation in Flutter
- **Direct Navigation**: Uses `MaterialPageRoute` to create a route with the target screen class as a parameter. The return value is a `Route`, which is then used with `Navigator.push` to navigate to the created route.
- **Static Navigation**: Declares a `Map<String, WidgetBuilder>` in `MaterialApp` to define routes. Navigation is done using `Navigator.pushNamed` with the route name.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Uses `onGenerateRoute` in `MaterialApp` to create routes based on `RouteSettings`. This method allows handling all routes in a single logic, making it easier to manage complex navigation scenarios.

---

### ‚úÖ Difference between package and plugin
A plugin is a type of package, but not all packages are plugins. Plugins can contain native code for both Android and iOS, while packages only contain Dart code. Plugins typically require access to the operating system's APIs, while packages do not.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between `async` and `await`?
- `async`: Marks a function as asynchronous, allowing it to return a `Future`. It enables the use of `await` within the function.
- `await`: Pauses the execution of an `async` function until the awaited `Future` completes. It allows you to work with the result of the `Future` without blocking the main thread.

--- 

### ‚úÖ What is MethodChannel?
MethodChannel is a way to communicate between Dart and native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS). It allows you to call platform-specific APIs from Flutter and vice versa. You can send messages and receive results using MethodChannel.

---

### ‚úÖ What is Key in Flutter?
A **`Key`** uniquely identifies widgets in the widget tree. It tells Flutter **which widgets to reuse** during rebuilds, helping to **preserve state**.


#### ‚ú® Common Use Cases:
- Reordering list items in `ListView`.
- Preserving input values in **forms** (`TextFormField`) during rebuilds.
- Accessing widget state with `GlobalKey` (e.g., validating a `Form`).


#### üîë Key Types:
- `ValueKey`: Based on a value (e.g. ID).
- `UniqueKey`: Always unique.
- `GlobalKey`: Access or manage widget state (e.g., `formKey.currentState?.validate()`).

---

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between `whenComplete` and `then`?
`whenComplete` is called after a `Future` completes, regardless of success or failure. It‚Äôs used for cleanup tasks. `then` is called only if the `Future` completes successfully and allows you to handle the result.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between double.infinity and MediaQuery.of(context).size.width?
- `double.infinity`: Represents an infinite value, used all the space available. It is not a finite value and can lead to layout issues if used inappropriately.
- `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width`: Returns the actual width of the screen, which is finite and can be used for responsive design. It provides the current screen size and orientation.

--- 

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between Cubit and BLoC?
The main difference between Cubit and Bloc is that Cubit is simpler and easier to use, while Bloc provides more powerful features for complex applications. You can choose to use Cubit for smaller or simpler applications, and Bloc for larger or more complex ones.
