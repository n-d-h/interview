### ‚úÖ What is Flutter and what is the concept?
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit by Google to build **natively compiled apps** from a single codebase for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded. It uses **widgets** as the building blocks of UI and supports **reactive, declarative programming**.

---

### ‚úÖ What are the advantages of Flutter?
- Single codebase for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
- Fast development with **hot reload** and **hot restart**
- Rich set of pre-designed widgets (Material & Cupertino)
- High performance with **Dart** and **Skia** rendering engine
- Open-source and large community support
- Beautiful UIs with customizable widgets

---

### ‚úÖ Explain the widget tree in Flutter
In Flutter, everything is a widget. The **widget tree** is a hierarchical structure of widgets that defines the UI. Each widget is responsible for a part of the UI and can contain other widgets. The tree starts from the root widget (usually `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`) and branches out to child widgets.

---

### ‚úÖ What tech is Flutter built with?
Flutter is built with:
- **Dart** (main language)
- **C++** (engine/core rendering)
- **Skia** (graphics engine)
- **Platform channels** for native iOS (Objective-C/Swift) and Android (Java/Kotlin) communication.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the concept of classes in Flutter?
Like in Dart, classes in Flutter define **blueprints for objects**, used to create widgets, manage state, or define models. Flutter heavily uses **OOP concepts** like inheritance, composition, and abstraction.

---

### ‚úÖ Error handler in Flutter?
Use:
- `try-catch` for sync/async errors
- `FlutterError.onError` for framework errors
- `runZonedGuarded()` for uncaught async errors
- `ErrorWidget.builder` to customize red screen errors in UI

---

### ‚úÖ Difference: mixin, extension, sealed, etc.

| Concept     | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Mixin**   | Reuse code across multiple classes (`with`) without inheritance. |
| **Extension** | Add functionality to existing types without changing their source. |
| **Sealed class** | A class restricted to a limited set of subclasses (Dart 3+). |
| **Abstract** | Cannot be instantiated; used for defining interfaces/contracts. |
| **Interface** | Dart doesn't have a keyword ‚Äî any class can act as an interface. |

---

### ‚úÖ MaterialApp vs CupertinoApp
- `MaterialApp`: Follows **Material Design** (Android-style)
- `CupertinoApp`: Follows **iOS-style** (Cupertino design)
Use them to match the native platform look and feel.

---

### ‚úÖ What do you need to do before production?
- Enable **code obfuscation** for security
- Run `flutter build --release`
- Remove unused dependencies
- Check for **performance, memory leaks**
- Handle **permissions**, background modes
- Configure **app icons, splash screen, versioning**
- Sign the app (keystore or iOS certificates)

---

### ‚úÖ What do you understand about Stream and its types?

**Stream**: A sequence of asynchronous events or data. It allows you to listen to data over time, like a radio station.
- **Single subscription stream**: Can be listened to only once. After the first listener, it can't be reused.
- **Broadcast stream**: Can have multiple listeners. Each listener gets its own copy of the data.

Usage:
- **Single subscription**: Only one listener can listen at a time. (Used for one-time async events like file reading or API response).
- **Broadcast**: Multiple listeners can subscribe. (Used for real-time updates like user input, Websockets, or BLoC streams. ).

>Example Code: Counter & Time Ticker

```java
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: StreamExample(),
    );
  }
}

class StreamExample extends StatefulWidget {
  const StreamExample({super.key});

  @override
  State<StreamExample> createState() => _StreamExampleState();
}

class _StreamExampleState extends State<StreamExample> {
  // ‚úÖ Single-subscription Stream: Emits a number once after delay
  Stream<int> singleValueStream = Future.delayed(
    const Duration(seconds: 2),
    () => 42,
  ).asStream();

  // ‚úÖ Broadcast Stream: Emits current time every second to multiple listeners
  late Stream<String> timeBroadcastStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    // Creating a broadcast stream using Stream.periodic
    timeBroadcastStream = Stream.periodic(
      const Duration(seconds: 1),
      (_) => DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    ).asBroadcastStream();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Stream Types Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // üéØ Single-subscription stream
            const Text('Single-subscription stream:'),
            StreamBuilder<int>(
              stream: singleValueStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) {
                if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                  return const CircularProgressIndicator();
                }
                return Text('Value: ${snapshot.data}');
              },
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 30),

            // üéØ Broadcast stream - 1st listener
            const Text('Broadcast stream (Time) - Listener 1:'),
            StreamBuilder<String>(
              stream: timeBroadcastStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) =>
                  Text(snapshot.data ?? 'Waiting...'),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 20),

            // üéØ Broadcast stream - 2nd listener
            const Text('Broadcast stream (Time) - Listener 2:'),
            StreamBuilder<String>(
              stream: timeBroadcastStream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) =>
                  Text(snapshot.data ?? 'Waiting...'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

### üîç What's happening here?

- `singleValueStream`: Created from a `Future`, it emits **one value after 2 seconds** ‚Üí a **single-subscription stream**.
- `timeBroadcastStream`: Emits the **current time every second**, and **both StreamBuilders** can listen ‚Üí a **broadcast stream**.

### ‚úÖ Null-aware operators

**Null-aware operators in Dart** help you write safer and more concise code when dealing with nullable variables. These operators are especially useful in avoiding `null`-related errors. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

1. **`??` (Null-coalescing operator)**  
   This returns the value on its left if it‚Äôs not `null`; otherwise, it returns the value on its right.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   String name = inputName ?? 'Guest';
   ```
   If `inputName` is null, `name` will be `'Guest'`.

2. **`??=` (Null-coalescing assignment operator)**  
   Assigns a value to a variable **only if it is currently null**.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   username ??= 'anonymous';
   ```
   This means "assign `'anonymous'` to `username` if `username` is null."

3. **`?.` (Null-aware access operator)**  
   Calls a method or accesses a property only if the object is not null, preventing a potential null error.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   user?.login();
   ```
   This only calls `login()` if `user` is not null.

4. **`!` (Null assertion operator)**  
   Forcefully tells the compiler that a value is **not null**, even if it's marked as nullable.  
   Example:  
   ```java
   String name = nullableName!;
   ```
   This should be used with caution. If `nullableName` is actually null, it will throw a runtime error.

---

### ‚úÖ Why do we pass a function to a widget?
To allow **child widgets to call back** and notify the parent ‚Äî enabling interaction and state changes (e.g., button press, form submit).

---

### ‚úÖ What is Future in Flutter?

In Flutter, a `Future` represents a value that will be available **sometime in the future**, typically after an **asynchronous operation**.  
- It can either **complete with a value** or **throw an error**.  
- We can use `await` to pause execution until the future completes, or use `.then()` to handle the result when it‚Äôs ready.

---

### ‚úÖ Build types in Flutter
- **Debug**: Fast build, includes debug tools & assertions
- **Profile**: Performance testing, no debugger
- **Release**: Optimized, stripped of debug info, ready for production

---

### ‚úÖ How to ship app to Google Play / App Store?

**For Android:**
- Update version in `pubspec.yaml` and `build.gradle`
- Sign with release key
- `flutter build apk` or `aab`
- Upload to Google Play Console

**For iOS:**
- Set version/build in Xcode
- Use provisioning profiles and certificates
- `flutter build ios`
- Upload via Xcode or Transporter to App Store Connect

---

### ‚úÖ Explain `main()` and `runApp()`

- `main()` is the app's entry point.
- `runApp()` takes a widget (usually `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`) and attaches it to the screen ‚Äî it's how Flutter builds the widget tree.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the BuildContext?
BuildContext is an object that represents the location of a widget in the widget tree. It is required for many operations, such as navigating between screens or showing dialogs.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the pubspec.yaml file used for?
The `pubspec.yaml` is a congiguration file where to define the dependencies, assets, fonts, and other settings for a Flutter project. It is used by the Dart package manager (`pub`) to manage packages and dependencies.

---

### ‚úÖ Explain the concept of Widget binding
`WidgetBinding` connects Flutter‚Äôs UI system to the platform.
It helps manage things like frame rendering, platform messages, and app lifecycle ‚Äî basically, it keeps your app and the OS in sync.

---

### ‚úÖ Difference between dependency and dev_dependency
- `dependencies`: Required for the app to run in production (e.g., `http`, `provider`).
- `dev_dependencies`: Required only during development (e.g., `flutter_test`, `build_runner`). They are not included in the production build.

---

### ‚úÖ What are types of tests in Flutter?
There are three main types of tests in Flutter:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions or classes (e.g., logic, models).
- **Widget tests**: Test a single widget's UI and behavior (e.g., button press, layout).
- **Integration tests**: Test the entire app or a large part of it (e.g., navigation, API calls). They run on a real device or emulator.
