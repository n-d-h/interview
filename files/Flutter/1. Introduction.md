# Flutter Introduction

I'm **Đức Hoàng**, a **Software Engineering** graduate from FPT University, passionate about **mobile** development. I have **7 months of real-world experience** from company projects and personal builds using **_Flutter with BLoC, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Messaging), SQLite, WebRTC/LiveKit, QR scanning, and RESTful/GraphQL APIs_**. I've worked on apps like QuanQuen (restaurant reservation), a ToDo app with multi-device offline/online sync, e-commerce apps, and management tools with video streaming. I’m eager to grow in a professional team and aim to become a **senior Flutter developer**.
